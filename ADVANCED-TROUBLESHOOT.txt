ðŸš¨ SITE STILL DOWN AFTER ADDING VARIABLES - ADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================================================

Since you've already added the environment variables but the site is still showing "Application failed to respond", let's troubleshoot deeper issues.

STEP 1: Check Railway Deployment Logs
------------------------------------
1. Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project
2. Click on "Deployments" or "Logs" tab
3. Look at the most recent deployment logs
4. Look for specific error messages

STEP 2: Common Issues When Variables Are Set
-------------------------------------------

ISSUE A: Redis Connection Problems
- Even with REDIS_URL set, the Redis server might be down
- Check if the Redis URL is still valid
- Try restarting the Redis service

ISSUE B: Port Binding Issues
- App might not be listening on the correct port
- Railway expects app to listen on process.env.PORT

ISSUE C: Build Failures
- Check if the build process completed successfully
- Look for npm install errors or dependency issues

ISSUE D: Memory/Timeout Issues
- App might be taking too long to start
- Check for infinite loops or blocking operations

STEP 3: Quick Diagnostic Commands
--------------------------------
Run these in your local terminal to test:

1. Test Redis connection:
   node -e "const Redis = require('ioredis'); const r = new Redis('redis://default:wipIKRLferhupCxLZxNOirxKzzXFFNTU@centerbeam.proxy.rlwy.net:36797'); r.ping().then(() => console.log('Redis OK')).catch(e => console.log('Redis Error:', e.message));"

2. Test app locally with production settings:
   NODE_ENV=production npm start

STEP 4: Force Redeploy with Debug
--------------------------------
1. In Railway Dashboard:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment
   - Add this variable:
     DEBUG=*
   - Redeploy

2. Check logs again for more detailed error messages

STEP 5: Alternative Redis URL (if current one fails)
---------------------------------------------------
If Redis connection is the issue, the current Redis server might be down.
You may need a new Redis URL. Try these free options:

1. Railway Redis Add-on:
   - In Railway, click "Add Service"
   - Select "Redis"
   - Use the generated REDIS_URL

2. Upstash Redis (free tier):
   - Go to upstash.com
   - Create free Redis database
   - Use their connection URL

STEP 6: Minimal Working Configuration
------------------------------------
Try removing all variables except these core ones:

REDIS_URL=redis://default:wipIKRLferhupCxLZxNOirxKzzXFFNTU@centerbeam.proxy.rlwy.net:36797
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=railway-boarding-pass-session-secret-2025
JWT_SECRET=railway-boarding-pass-jwt-secret-2025

Remove PayPal and SMTP variables temporarily to isolate the issue.

STEP 7: Check Railway Service Status
-----------------------------------
1. Visit Railway status page: status.railway.app
2. Check if there are any ongoing issues

STEP 8: Emergency Fallback - New Deployment
------------------------------------------
If nothing works:
1. Create a new Railway project
2. Connect the same GitHub repo
3. Set environment variables fresh
4. Deploy to new project

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN LOGS:
- "ECONNREFUSED" = Connection refused (likely Redis)
- "ENOTFOUND" = DNS resolution failed
- "TIMEOUT" = Connection timeout
- "Port already in use" = Port binding issue
- "Cannot find module" = Missing dependencies

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Check Railway deployment logs first
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Share the error details for targeted fix

The "Application failed to respond" with variables set usually means:
- Redis server is down/unreachable
- App is crashing during startup
- Build process failed
- Port binding issues
